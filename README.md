## Introduction & Aims

We are a newly formed team and are starting to translate Nobihaza games (and possibly other games in the future) with the best quality possible!

The Firefly Project is a completely non-profit translation team, the products of the team will be completely free and everyone can play. However, because it is non-profit, we may only operate in our free time, and the time to release products will also be longer than usual.

In GitHub, we also make some experimental projects just for fun, but it may help some specific groups of people that also aims the same target as all of us.

## Members

Currently, our members are usually non-public, but [Serena1432](https://github.com/Serena1432) is the founder of the team.

The team will operate as “all equals”, with equal authority and equal work, each person making up for what the other can’t do. No one is actually the team leader, and the “ownership” of the server and team on GitHub is just to keep the team from being vandalized, and serves no other purpose.

## Projects

You can view all of our projects in the **Repositories** tab or one of the links above.

Although we have just been established, we will definitely expand and release more projects in the future, so please look forward to it! Thank you very much!
